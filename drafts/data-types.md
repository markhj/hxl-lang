# Draft: Data types

> **Important**:
> This is a draft of an HXL feature which is not yet part of the official specification

This page is mainly a brainstorming of future data types which would
be interesting to support.

## List

- Bitflags
- Enums
- Maps
- Tri-state values (-1, 0, 1)

## ``NULL``

For the time being, there's no plans to implement ``NULL``.

A comprehensive pros/cons list will be needed before any implementation
details are to be made.
