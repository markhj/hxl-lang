**HXL** is a data interchange format like JSON or YAML. The syntax is somewhat YAML-like,
but it sports a number of useful features such as references and inheritance.

HXL was conceived while working on a game engine, but HXL's usefulness spoke to making
it a project in its own right.

This repository outlines the **specification of the language**.
For actual implementations, please refer to the list further down.

## üìå Specifications

There is currently only a single specification available.

- [HXL.2024](https://github.com/markhj/hxl-lang/blob/master/specs/hxl-2024.md)

The rate at which new implementations will be defined is yet to be determined.

## üåø Implementations

| Language | HXL spec. | Min. version | Repository                             |
|----------|-----------|--------------|----------------------------------------|
| C++      | 2024.1    | C++20        | https://github.com/markhj/cpp-hxl-lang |

## üíù Contribute

You can contribute by writing implementations in other programming languages
or improve on existing.

Simply open an issue or a pull request towards this library to have your
implementation listed above.

### IDE plug-ins

Another way to contribute is writing plug-ins for IDEs which can provide:

- Syntax highlighting
- Syntax validation
- Reference data points in the code (when possible)

## üå± Drafts

In the ``drafts`` directory, you can explore ideas for upcoming features,
which are not yet part of the official specification.
